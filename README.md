Automobiles are no longer just mechanical devices. Todayâ€™s automobiles contain a  number of different electronic components networked together that as a whole are  responsible for monitoring and controlling the state of the vehicle. Each component,  from the Anti-Lock Brake module to the Instrument Cluster to the Telematics module,  can communicate with neighboring components. Modern automobiles contain upwards  of 50 electronic control units (ECUs) networked together. The overall safety of the  vehicle relies on near real time communication between these various ECUs. While  communicating with each other, ECUs are responsible for predicting crashes, detecting  skids, performing anti-lock braking, etc.
